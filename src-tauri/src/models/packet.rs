// how can I use this in terms of packet?

struct Packet {
    pub id: u8,
    pub size: u8,
    pub status: bool,
    pub payload: vec![u8],
}

// how do I implement method to send packet like this into byte and send it over stream?
// maybe it's this part I don't quite understand fully or it doesn't click me yet.
// let me try a few example and see if I could just manually run blender from the web browser?
